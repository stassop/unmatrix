Unmatrix is a jQuery plugin that decomposes a CSS matrix back into intelligible values.

Usage example:

(function($) {
    $(document).ready(function() {
        var transforms = $(".class-name").unmatrix();
    });
})(jQuery);

The plugin returns an array of objects if the browser supports transforms, or null if it doesn't. Each item in the array can be either null if the element has no transforms, or an object with the followig properties: rotate, rotateX, rotateY, rotateZ, scaleX, scaleY, scaleZ, skew, skewX, skewY, x, y, z. 

Notes:

The plugin uses James Coglan's awesome library Sylvester with a few minor modifications, hence it's included with the rest of the code. For more information on Sylvester see

When interpolating between 2 matrices, each is decomposed into the corresponding translation, rotation, scale, skew and perspective values. Not all matrices can be accurately described by these values. Those that can't are decomposed into the most accurate representation possible. This technique works on a 4x4 homogeneous matrix.

Apparently, for an accurate result the obtained values should sometimes be applied in a different order than the original transform. See index.html.
