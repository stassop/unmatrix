# Unmatrix

Unmatrix is a JS module that decomposes a transform matrix to the original values.

`Unmatrix.getTransform()`
returns an object with properties
`rotate`, `rotateX`, `rotateY`, `rotateZ`, `scaleX`, `scaleY`, `scaleZ`,
`skew`, `skewX`, `skewY`, `translateX`, `translateY`, `translateZ`,
or `null` if no transform is found.

See demo [here](http://stassop.github.io/unmatrix/)

### Install

```
npm install unmatrix
```

### Example

```javascript
import Unmatrix from 'unmatrix';
const element = document.querySelector('#myElement');
const transform = Unmatrix.getTransform(element);
```

### Notes

Unmatrix uses James Coglan's library [Sylvester](http://sylvester.jcoglan.com/),
and has [sylvester-es6](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sylvester-es6) as a dependency.

The decomposition method is based upon the "unmatrix" method in
"Graphics Gems II, edited by Jim Arvo", but modified to use Quaternions instead
of Euler angles to avoid the problem of Gimbal Locks.

When interpolating between two matrices, each is decomposed into the
corresponding translation, rotation, scale, skew and perspective values.

**Not all matrices can be accurately described by these values.
Those that can't are decomposed into the most accurate representation possible.**

This technique works on a 4x4 homogeneous matrix.
